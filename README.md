#### The goal of the credit scoring model builder is to create a predictive model that assesses the default probability of borrowers in the banking industry. By predicting the likelihood of borrowers failing to repay their debts, lenders can make informed credit decisions and effectively manage risk.

## What is Credit?
In the banking industry, credit refers to the provision of funds or resources by one party (the lender) to another party (the borrower) with the expectation that the borrowed funds will be repaid at a later date, usually with interest. It allows individuals and businesses to access financial resources when they need them, such as loans and credit cards.

- Filtering Gate
A filtering gate is a preliminary step in the credit evaluation process, where potential borrowers are screened based on certain criteria. These criteria may include credit scores, income level, employment history, and other financial indicators. Borrowers who meet the filtering gate requirements proceed to the next stage of the credit evaluation process.

- Credit Score
A credit score is a numerical representation of a borrower's creditworthiness, which is used by lenders to assess the risk associated with lending money to that individual or entity. The credit score is typically generated by credit bureaus based on the borrower's credit history and various financial factors. A higher credit score indicates a lower risk of default and is more likely to result in favorable loan terms.

## Basic Idea on Creating a Credit Scoring Model
The primary objective of creating a credit scoring model in the banking industry is to predict the default probability of borrowers. Default probability refers to the likelihood that a borrower will fail to repay their debt within a certain period of time. By predicting this probability, lenders can make more informed decisions about extending credit and can manage their overall risk exposure more effectively.

## Modeling Workflow
Building a credit scoring model involves several key steps, which are outlined below:

- Data Preparation
In this step, relevant data for model building is gathered. This data may include historical borrower information, loan performance data, credit history, employment details, and other relevant financial indicators. The data should be collected from reliable sources and appropriately formatted for analysis.

- Sample Selection
The next step involves selecting a representative sample from the collected data. The sample should be diverse and representative of the borrower population. Care should be taken to avoid any biases in the sample selection process that could lead to skewed model results.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is a crucial step in understanding the data and gaining insights into the relationships between various variables. Data visualization and statistical analysis techniques are used to explore patterns, identify outliers, and understand the distribution of the target variable (default/non-default).

- Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is performed to clean and transform the data to make it suitable for model training. This step may involve handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and other data transformations.

- Create and Evaluate Model
In this step, a predictive model is created using machine learning algorithms. Commonly used algorithms for credit scoring models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks. The model is trained on the prepared data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Model Prediction
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the default probability of new borrowers. Lenders can integrate the credit scoring model into their credit approval process to assess the risk associated with each borrower accurately.

Remember that building a credit scoring model is an ongoing process. As new data becomes available and the performance of the model is monitored, updates and refinements may be necessary to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.
